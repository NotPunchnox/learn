# Neural Language Model

This project implements a simple question-answering model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Keras and TensorFlow. The model is designed to handle a limited vocabulary and is suitable for educational purposes and experimentation.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd neural-language-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The data should be in the `data/sample_qa.txt` file, containing question-answer pairs.
2. **Training the Model**: Run the `src/main.py` file to initialize the model, prepare the data, and start the training process.
3. **Generating Responses**: After training, you can use the model to generate responses to questions by calling the `generate_response` function in `main.py`.

## Model Architecture

The project includes two types of models:
- **RNN Model**: A simple recurrent neural network for sequence prediction.
- **LSTM Model**: A more advanced model using LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the data.
